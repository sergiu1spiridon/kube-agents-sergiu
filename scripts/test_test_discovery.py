"""Every test_*.py in the tree either runs in CI or is excluded here, by name.

`make test-python` discovers tests from PYTHON_TEST_DIRS, a fixed list of
wildcards. A test directory the wildcards miss does not fail anything -- it
just never runs, and the suite reports green around it. That is how eight test
files (the memory provider's six and bench's two) sat unexecuted on every
pull request for months: nothing owned the difference between "excluded on
purpose" and "missed by a glob".

This test owns that difference. It walks the tree for test_*.py files,
subtracts EXCLUDED, and asserts every surviving directory is discovered. From
here on, skipping a directory means adding a reviewed line to EXCLUDED with a
reason -- it cannot happen by accident of a glob again.

PYTHON_TEST_DIRS is read by invoking make itself on a wrapper makefile, not by
parsing the Makefile's text: the value that matters is the one make expands,
and a regex re-implementation would drift from it.
