"""Unit tests for resolver.py, the github-issue-resolver skill's helper.

Run: python3 -m unittest agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/scripts/test_resolver.py

Two properties carry most of the weight here.

The first is the distinction between *silence* and *fault*. "No repository is
configured" and "the repository is configured but I cannot read it" both stop
the resolver, but only the first is a supported state. If both are reported the
same way, the skill silences both, and a deployment whose SETTINGS.md has a
typo in it stops triaging issues permanently with nobody the wiser. Every
routing test below exists to keep those two outcomes apart.

The second is that ``--report-file`` is confined to the scratch directory. The
report is posted to a public issue and then unlinked, so a path that escapes
the directory is both an exfiltration and an arbitrary-delete primitive. Those
tests assert the rejection happens *before* any ``gh`` call and before the
unlink, not merely that an error is printed.
