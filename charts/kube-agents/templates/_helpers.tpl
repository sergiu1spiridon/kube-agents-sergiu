Rewrite an image repository onto a registry prefix, keeping only the trailing
image name: quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-webhook under "reg.example.com/m"
becomes reg.example.com/m/cert-manager-webhook. That flat layout is what
scripts/mirror_images.sh writes and what the operator assumes when it derives
the credential-proxy reference from the agent one. An empty registry returns
the repository untouched, so a default install renders byte-identically.

The trailing segment is a stand-in for the real rule. mirror_images.sh names
each destination after the images.json entry's .name, and a chart cannot read
images.json at render time, so this reproduces it by convention rather than by
lookup. An image whose inventory name differs from its trailing segment
(hindsight-postgresql is docker.io/ankane/pgvector) cannot use this helper —
kube-agents.thirdPartyImage below takes the real name explicitly. Check 3c in
hack/check-image-inventory.sh fails the build when a rendered mirror name is
not an inventory name, which is what keeps the shortcut safe.

copy's digest differs from the upstream one, so keeping it would break every
mirrored pull — while unmirrored installs pull the inventory's full pin,
digest and all.

`name` is the images.json entry name, which is what mirror_images.sh names the
destination; it defaults to the repository's trailing segment, the common case
where the two agree. Passing it explicitly is what lets an image like

the case this feature exists for (<svc>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local, or the shortened <svc>.<ns>).

Anything else — an external vendor endpoint, a bare hostname — fails the render, but only
when litellm.otel is on. Silently falling back to gke-managed-otel would emit a policy that
blocks the very collector the user just configured, and the symptom would be zero spans
with a green install. With litellm.otel off (the default) there is no LiteLLM exporter for
the policy to block, so failing the whole install over an egress rule nothing uses would
punish a user who only meant to repoint the agents.
