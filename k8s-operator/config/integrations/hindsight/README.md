# Hindsight deployment

The long-term memory store behind the Chat Agent's `kube_agents_memory` provider:
a [Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) API server and the
Postgres/pgvector database it keeps its memories in.

Why the design is what it is — one bank, scope tags, the settings the provider
pins — lives in [tag isolation](../../../../docs/designs/memory.md). This
README covers only the manifests in this directory.

## Install

Nothing here is a manual step. Hindsight is
the chart (`hindsight.*` in `charts/kube-agents/values.yaml`), which renders
the same store whenever a hindsight-backed memory provider is selected. These
kustomize copies are the dev path:

```sh
make -C k8s-operator deploy-hindsight
```

`make deploy-hindsight` applies the manifests as-is: no readiness gate — the API
takes longer than anything else here to come up, because it loads its embedding
and reranking models at startup — and no provider gate, so it deploys whatever
you point it at. On the real install path the chart carries both gates: it
renders this store only when the memory provider is Hindsight-backed
(`kube_agents_memory` or `hindsight`), and a stock install — the file-based
`multiuser_memory` default — runs no database. See
[choosing a provider](../../../../docs/designs/memory.md#choosing-a-provider).

To apply the manifests directly:

```sh
cd k8s-operator && make deploy-hindsight
```

Not `kubectl apply -k` on this directory: both images are `${…}` variables, and
kustomize alone leaves them unsubstituted for the API server to reject. The
target resolves them from `images.json` and runs `envsubst` first.

There is nothing else to configure and no prerequisite Secret. Both images are
pinned by digest; `ankane/pgvector` publishes only a floating `latest`, so the
digest is the only thing standing between a pod reschedule and a different
database engine. Both pins live in [`images.json`](../../../../images.json) at
the repository root, not here — that is what lets `make mirror-images` copy them
and a mirrored install ask for the copy. Re-pin there, deliberately, rather than
dropping the digest.

## No credentials

Neither workload reads a Secret, and that is a decision rather than an oversight.

**Postgres takes no password.** `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` and a DSN with
no password in it. What keeps the database private is a ClusterIP service with no
route in from outside the cluster, and — on clusters that enforce it —
[`networkpolicy.yaml`](networkpolicy.yaml), which lets only the Hindsight API pod
reach port 5432. A password would add an install step (generate it, keep two keys
in agreement, rotate it) to protect an in-cluster database from pods that are
already trusted with the memories it holds.

Note the qualifier on the NetworkPolicy. GKE enforces one only where the cluster
was created with Dataplane V2 or `--enable-network-policy`; everywhere else the
object applies cleanly and does nothing, and any pod in the namespace can open a
connection. That is the same footing as the `litellm` and `github-token-minter`
policies this repo already ships, so it is a property of the cluster to check
rather than of this directory to fix — but check it before treating the policy as
the boundary.

One consequence to know: `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD` is read by `initdb` and
baked into `pg_hba.conf` when the volume is first created. Setting it on a volume
that already exists does nothing — an existing database keeps whatever auth
method it was initialised with, and the passwordless DSN will be rejected. Moving
an existing install onto this manifest means deleting
`data-hindsight-postgresql-0`, which discards every stored memory.

**LiteLLM takes no key either.** The gateway runs without a master key — the
agents authenticate to it with the literal string `none`
([`deploy/shared/defaults/config.yaml`](../../../../deploy/shared/defaults/config.yaml)) and
Hindsight does the same. The value is a placeholder the OpenAI-compatible client
insists on, not a credential. The real provider keys (Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI)
live in LiteLLM's own secret and never reach this pod.

## What the agent connects to

```
http://hindsight-api.kubeagents-system.svc.cluster.local:8888
```

Nothing bakes that URL in. The operator derives it from the agent's namespace and
passes it as `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`; `agents/chat/defaults/hindsight/config.json`
carries `mode`, `memory_mode` and `recall_budget` and deliberately **no**
`api_url` key, because the plugin prefers the file over the environment and a
value left there would outrank the operator's silently. Installing into a
different namespace therefore needs no edit and no image rebuild. The manifests
are namespace-agnostic for the same reason — every in-cluster address in them is
a short service name, and the deploy target applies them with `kubectl apply -n`.

The config file itself is image-owned: the entrypoint force-syncs it onto the
agent's PVC on every start, so a hand-edit there is overwritten on the next roll.
That is deliberate — see the comment above the force-sync loop in
[`deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh`](../../../../deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh).

There are no banks to provision. A Hindsight bank does not exist until something
writes to it, and the provider creates `kube-agents-memory` with its mission and
retain strategies on the first session that stores anything.

## Teardown

`make -C k8s-operator undeploy-hindsight` removes the workloads and **keeps the volume**.
A StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplate` PVC is not owned by these manifests, so
re-deploying reattaches it with every memory intact. Discard
them explicitly:

```sh
kubectl delete pvc data-hindsight-postgresql-0 -n kubeagents-system
```

## Notes

- **No Hugging Face egress.** The API image bakes its embedding and reranking
  models in, and `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` / `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` keep the libraries from
  reaching for the network on a cold start — which would hang, not fail fast,
  where there is no route out of the cluster.
- **LLM calls go through LiteLLM**, the same gateway the agents use, so model
  routing and cost attribution stay in one place. That makes step 9 a
  prerequisite for step 13.
- **The database is the memory.** Deleting the `data-hindsight-postgresql-0` PVC
  discards every stored memory. There is no other copy.
- **Metrics.** The API serves Prometheus text on its ordinary port (8888,
  `/metrics`), scraped by GKE Managed Prometheus through
  [`podmonitoring.yaml`](podmonitoring.yaml). Postgres exports nothing. What the
  metrics are good for is the site's
  [observability page](../../../../docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/observability.md).
- **`app.kubernetes.io/component`.** These are the only objects in the repo that
  set it, because one integration here runs two unrelated workloads. It is in
  both selectors, so it cannot be changed without recreating the Deployment and
  StatefulSet. See the site's
  [resource labels reference](../../../../docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/resource-labels.md).
