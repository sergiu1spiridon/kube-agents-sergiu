# API server and a Postgres database in the cluster, while `multiuser_memory`
# keeps a per-user Markdown file inside the pod and needs nothing at all. The
# rest are the external plugins Hermes ships — see `memory.provider` in its
# hermes_cli/config.py.
#
# `multiuser_memory` is the default because it is what this repo shipped before
# `kube_agents_memory` existed: re-running provisioning against an install that
# never chose a provider must not silently grow it a Postgres database.
#
# `none` is this installer's spelling of "no external provider — keep Hermes'
# built-in store". Hermes itself spells that as the empty string, but an empty
# string cannot survive the trip through the CR: an absent field takes the CRD
# default, and the operator only overrides a non-empty one. So the choice is
