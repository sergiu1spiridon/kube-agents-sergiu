"""Unit tests for the Google Chat attachment-notice patch applied by the Dockerfile.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/docker/patches -p 'test_*.py' -t deploy/docker/patches

``UPSTREAM`` below carries ``_post_attachment_fallback`` copied verbatim out of
``plugins/platforms/google_chat/adapter.py`` in the pinned base image, wrapped in
the smallest class and preamble that will run it. The anchor is exercised against
the text it was derived from rather than against a paraphrase, and the patched
result is then *run*, because the defect is in what the user reads: an applier
whose anchor matched and which then emitted Spanish, or English pointing at a
command that does nothing here, would be no use.

The two branches are the substance. ``/setup-files`` is real guidance on an
install that talks to Google Chat directly and a dead end on one that goes
through the credential proxy, so which branch says it is the assertion that
matters most, and it is the one a grep in the Dockerfile cannot make.
