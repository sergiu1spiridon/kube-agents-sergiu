"""Say the attachment failed in English, and say something that is true.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against the Hermes tree at
``plugins/platforms/google_chat/adapter.py``.

The bug
-------
``_post_attachment_fallback`` is the notice a user gets when the bot produced a
file and could not upload it. Upstream ships its four user-facing lines in
Spanish, inside an otherwise English adapter with an English docstring above
them::

    f"⚠️ No he podido adjuntar **{filename}**.",
    "Google Chat sólo permite adjuntar archivos cuando el bot tiene "
    "permiso explícito tuyo (OAuth de usuario). Es un consentimiento "
    "único que se hace desde este chat.",
    "**Para activarlo:** envía `/setup-files` y sigue las instrucciones.",
    f"Mientras tanto el archivo está en el host: `{path}`",

Everything around it is English -- the adapter, its docstrings, the ``error=``
string this same method returns -- so it reads to the person in the thread as
the agent having switched language mid-conversation, which is how it was
reported and what sent the first investigation after the model rather than
after the adapter.

Nothing about it is rare. Native ``media.upload`` needs a *per-user* OAuth
token, so the notice fires on every attachment until each user has run
``/setup-files`` in their own DM. On the staging install this was reported
from, no user had: ``$HERMES_HOME/google_chat_user_tokens`` did not exist, so
every card that attached a file took this path. Card ``t_e5e1ba5e`` delivered a
9,867-byte report that way on 2026-08-18, and ``gateway.log`` carries the
matching ``[Google_Chat] Failed to send media (.md)`` from 2026-08-11.

The second defect
-----------------
The Spanish text tells the user to run ``/setup-files``. On an install that
reaches Chat through the credential proxy, that command does nothing:
``agents/platform/scripts/google_chat_relay_patch.py`` replaces
``_handle_setup_files_command`` with a stub answering "File attachment setup is
unavailable through the credential proxy", because the OAuth flow needs
credentials the relay deliberately does not hold. Translating the line without
touching it would ship an English dead end.

Upstream's notice always ended with something the user could do, and dropping
``/setup-files`` on the relay branch would end it with a host path they cannot
reach. So that branch offers the one thing that does work there: asking the
agent to paste the contents into the chat, which needs no credentials because
the file is already on the agent's own disk.

So the middle of the notice branches on whether the relay patch is installed,
which it records as ``_credential_proxy_relay_patched`` (``RELAY_FLAG`` below)
on the adapter class. The attribute is set in ``patch_adapter_class`` at adapter
construction, well before any message is sent, and reading it through
``type(self)`` means an install with no relay is unaffected: it keeps the
``/setup-files`` instruction, because there the command works.

Every install the operator deploys takes the relay branch --
``k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`` sets
``GOOGLE_CHAT_RELAY_URL`` whenever ``integration.googleChat.enabled`` is true,
and ``sitecustomize.py`` installs the patch on that variable alone. The other
branch is for an image run outside the operator, and it is kept rather than
folded away because deleting it would leave the instruction hard-coded off in
the one configuration where it works.

That the flag is private to the relay patch is the fragile part of this: a
rename there silently restores the dead end and nothing in the adapter would
notice. ``test_google_chat_attachment_notice.py`` reads the relay patch's own
source and asserts the assignment, so the rename fails CI rather than shipping.

What is deliberately not changed
--------------------------------
The ``error=`` string on the returned ``SendResult``. It is English already and
it goes to ``gateway.log``, not to a user, so the one reader it has is someone
grepping for why an upload failed — "run /setup-files in chat" is the right
lead for them even on a relay install, where the next thing they find is the
stub refusing.

Neither does this make attachments work. The file still only exists on the
agent host, and the notice still says so; the user-facing fix for that is
either per-user OAuth or having the notifier inline a report rather than
attach it, and both are larger than a string.

Upstream: not reported. Worth doing — nobody running Hermes in an English
deployment wants this — but the branch above is kube-agents-specific and would
not survive the trip, so the two are separate pieces of work.
