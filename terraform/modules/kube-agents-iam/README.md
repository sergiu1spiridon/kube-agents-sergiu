# Kube-Agents IAM & Workload Identity Module

Reusable Terraform module for provisioning the Platform Agent's Google Service Account (GSA), its Workload Identity binding, and its project-level IAM roles.

## Relationship to the install

This is the module the full-install composition (and therefore `install.sh`) uses for the
agent's identity. The canonical identifiers (GSA `kubeagents-platform-gsa`, KSA
`kubeagents-platform-agent`, namespace `kubeagents-system`) also appear in
`k8s-operator/scripts/common.sh` for the dev tooling, and the module's defaults mirror
them.

By default the module grants the read-only role set (the composition's
`permission_set = "read-only"`, also the installer's default). Pass `project_roles = []` to grant
nothing and manage roles yourself — but note the agent fails every GCP call until an
equivalent role set exists. The `gke-admin` set can be reproduced by passing those
roles explicitly (see `local.gke_admin_roles` in the full-install composition).

## Usage

```hcl
module "kube_agents_iam" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents.git//terraform/modules/kube-agents-iam?ref=1.2.0"
  project_id         = "my-gcp-project"
  service_account_id = "kubeagents-platform-gsa"
  namespace          = "kubeagents-system"
  ksa_name           = "kubeagents-platform-agent"
}
```
